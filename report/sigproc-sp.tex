\section{Introduction}
\vspace{2mm}
Every day lots of articles are published by many newspapers and websites. As a consequence, the same news is repeated in many sources causing confusion to readers which have to choose the most interesting ones. Fortunately, there are websites which everyday explore articles from different surces and group them together. The most famous one is Google News\footnote{https://news.google.com}. It actually \textit{aggregates} headlines from news sources worldwide which treat the same news and gives to readers a list of the most \textit{representative} ones for each group. While the title provided by Google is the same as the one written in the source, the body is a paragraph of the article which belongs to the source and allows readers to get instantaneously significant information. The aims of our work is to replicate what Google News provides, focusing on italian articles. The proposed solution provides to readers a list of articles with no duplicates: for each group of similar news we provide the most representative one to show.

\section{Motivating Example}
\vspace{2mm}
The best example from which we took inspiration is Google News. It is simple, fast and personilizable. News may be filtered by personalized interests, locations and other preferences. The aim of our work is to help readers to read news that really represent their interests. In this way, readers do not have to read all the articles that are published and do not have to skip news for which they are not interested in.

%\section{Problem Statement}
%vspace{2mm}
%The problem we face in is twofold: a tipical scenario as the one described in the section 1 can be divided into two steps. The first phase is to find the right way to aggregate similar articles. The second phase is to chose the article from each group which represent the entire cluster. The first challenge we face in was to understand how when different news have to be considered similar.

\section{Data mining}
\vspace{2mm}
\subsection{The Problem}
\vspace{2mm}
The problem is to present to the user tha main news happened the day before. We start from a dataset of news collected from different source. Our goals is divided in two main task:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find similar news in a day and cluster it together.
\item Find a rappresentative news for each cluster to present to the user.
\end{enumerate}
We also try to have a trade of beetween quality and performance. We need high performance also because the idea is replicate google news that has a lot of sources for each country and a lot of users with gigabytes of data.
\subsection{Solution}
The first step is remove eventual news duplication. This is caused because different newspapers copy the text of the news from other newspapers.\\
The second step is to remove the stop word from the dataset. We remove stop word because they are common and repeated for every news so they doesn't give any information about the news.\\
For similarity measure of the news we need to have an high value if the two news have a lot of common word over the totality of the word of each news.For this fact we choosed as similarity the jaccard similarity. The jaccard similarity is largerly used for comparing sets and document like our case. The jaccard similarity is defined in the following formula.$$Jaccard(A,B) = \frac{\left\vert A \cap B \right\vert}{\left\vert A \cup B \right\vert}$$
To optimize the jaccard similarity we have builded a matrix where the row are the element present in the all set and the column are the document. The cell can take value 1 if the element is present in the relative document and 0 if not. With this matrix every jaccard similarity computation have a complexity on O(n) and in this way we compare number which cost a lot less of comparing string. \\
With this matrix we can do another stop of optimization. We can build a signature matrix using a min hash function as described in [CIT]. If the number of permutation is high (e.g. 100 permutation) this signature matrix preserve the distance beetween document loosing only a few information. The advantage of having this signature matrix is that it occupies in memory a space proportion to (Documents per Number of permutation) instead of having (Document per Number of item). In this way we save a lot space and a lot time in computation.

We tryed different tecniques to try to cluster news.
Our first attempt to cluster news is the agglomerative clustering. This is the very basic idea. We start with clusters of one news each. Now with a recoursive strategy we continuesly merge the 2 cluster with the lowest distance. We stop we the distance of the two closer cluster over a threashold value.\\
The distance measure used is: $$ 1 - jaccard(C_1,C_2)$$
We always merge the two closer cluster. To determine the distance beetween to cluster we used different tecnique. The first one is to choose for each of the two cluster the closest point to the other cluster and take the distance of this two point as the distance of the two cluster. The second tecnique, similarly as the first, is to choose for each of the two cluster the further point to the other cluster and take the distance of this two point as the distance of the two cluster. The third is take the average of the distance beetween the point of the two cluster as the distance of the two clusters.\\
We this clustering method we faced 2 main problems. The first one is that there was always few cluster really big with a lot of news and a lot of small clusters. This happened with all of the three of distance measure beetween clusters, also with takeing the average that we taught it was the best. The second problem is the difficulty of determine the threshold value to stop the clustering. If is too high there are few clusters with a lot of news and if it is to small there are a too much clusters with few news each.\\
After we faced this two problems we decided to abandon this idea and we changed clustering method.

The second method used.


\section{Big Data}
\vspace{2mm}

\subsection{The dataset}
\vspace{2mm}
We started by collecting data from the Google News's website. We built a crawler which downloads the feed rss of all the news which belong to the home page. 
Each feed rss downloaded by the crawler is parsed and for each news written in it we extract many attributes. The most relevant ones are the following: title, body, name of the source, published date, url of the feed, url of the source.
Afterward, the news are stored in a json file. We decided to store articles in a single file rather than divide each news in a single file. However, this process can be easily converted in a distributed one using one NoSQL Database Management System such as MongoDb, in which each document is an article.



\subsection{Text optimization}

Once we store the list of news downloaded from the crawler we perform some features in order to clean them from xml and html tags, 

Given the list of news we perform some features in order to clean 


Stop words are removed from both the title and the body of each news. We stored all the stop words in a single file, once loaded in memory 







\subsection{Math Equations}
You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of
the three are discussed in the next sections.

\subsubsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
A formula that appears in the running text is called an
inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
\textbf{math} environment, which can be
invoked with the usual \texttt{{\char'134}begin. . .{\char'134}end}
construction or with the short form \texttt{\$. . .\$}. You
can use any of the symbols and structures,
from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX this section will simply show a
few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
this equation: \begin{math}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsubsection{Display Equations}
A numbered display equation -- one set off by vertical space
from the text and centered horizontally -- is produced
by the \textbf{equation} environment. An unnumbered display
equation is produced by the \textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in \LaTeX; this section will just
give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\subsection{Citations}
Citations to articles,
conference
proceedings listed
in the Bibliography section of your
article will occur throughout the text of your article.
You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
a key of the item cited in the proper location in
the \texttt{.tex} file.
The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
the first author's surname and a
word from the title.  This identifying key is included
with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.

The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
Guide}.

This article shows only the plainest form
of the citation command, using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.
This is what is stipulated in the SIGS style specifications.
No other citation format is endorsed.

\subsection{Tables}
Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
placement for them is typically the top of the page
nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
on \textbf{tabular} material
is found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 1 is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed
dvi output of this document.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\ \hline
\O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\ \hline
$\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\ \hline
\$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\ \hline
$\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of
the page's live area, use the environment
\textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this wide
table will ``float" to a location deemed more desirable.
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 2 is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the
table here with the table in the printed dvi
output of this document.


\begin{table*}
\centering
\caption{Some Typical Commands}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Command&A Number&Comments\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}alignauthor} & 100& Author alignment\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}numberofauthors}& 200& Author enumeration\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\ \hline\end{tabular}
\end{table*}
% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!

\subsection{Figures}
Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the
best placement for them
is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest
their initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement
of figures, use the environment
\textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and its caption.

This sample document contains examples of \textbf{.eps}
and \textbf{.ps} files to be displayable with \LaTeX.  More
details on each of these is found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.

As was the case with tables, you may want a figure
that spans two columns.  To do this, and still to
ensure proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment
\textbf{figure*} to enclose the figure and its caption.

Note that either {\textbf{.ps}} or {\textbf{.eps}} formats are
used; use
the \texttt{{\char'134}epsfig} or \texttt{{\char'134}psfig}
commands as appropriate for the different file types.

\subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
Other common constructs that may occur in your article are
the forms for logical constructs like theorems, axioms,
corollaries and proofs.  There are
two forms, one produced by the
command \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} and the
other by the command \texttt{{\char'134}newdef}; perhaps
the clearest and easiest way to distinguish them is
to compare the two in the output of this sample document:

This uses the \textbf{theorem} environment, created by
the\linebreak\texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} command:
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\begin{theorem}
Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
\begin{displaymath}\int^b_af(t)dt = G(b) - G(a).\end{displaymath}
\end{theorem}

The other uses the \textbf{definition} environment, created
by the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command:
\newdef{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
unique number which has
logarithm $z$: \begin{displaymath}{\log e^z = z}\end{displaymath}
\end{definition}

Two lists of constructs that use one of these
forms is given in the
\textit{Author's  Guidelines}.
and don't forget to end the environment with
{figure*}, not {figure}!
 
There is one other similar construct environment, which is
already set up
for you; i.e. you must \textit{not} use
a \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to
create it: the \textbf{proof} environment.  Here
is a example of its use:
\begin{proof}
Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
\begin{displaymath}
\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
\end{displaymath}
Then
\begin{displaymath}
l=\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ]
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\cdot L = 0,
\end{displaymath}
which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
\end{proof}

Complete rules about using these environments and using the
two different creation commands are in the
\textit{Author's Guide}; please consult it for more
detailed instructions.  If you need to use another construct,
not listed therein, which you want to have the same
formatting as the Theorem
or the Definition shown above,
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} or the
\texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command,
respectively, to create it.

\subsection*{A {\secit Caveat} for the \TeX\ Expert}
Because you have just been given permission to
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to create a
new form, you might think you can
use \TeX's \texttt{{\char'134}def} to create a
new command: \textit{Please refrain from doing this!}
Remember that your \LaTeX\ source code is primarily intended
to create camera-ready copy, but may be converted
to other forms -- e.g. HTML. If you inadvertently omit
some or all of the \texttt{{\char'134}def}s recompilation will
be, to say the least, problematic.

\section{Conclusions}
This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
Appendices; brief samples of these
follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
this paper are to articles which have nothing to
do with the present subject and are used as
examples only.
